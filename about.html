                    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                    <p class="lead">From vision to reality – building sustainable energy infrastructure at industrial scale</p>
                    
                    <p>Founded in April 2022, Tirhuta Urja Udyog Pvt Ltd emerged with a bold vision: to transform India's agricultural and organic waste challenge into a sustainable energy opportunity. We recognized that the vast amounts of waste generated across rural India represented not just an environmental challenge, but a massive untapped energy resource.</p>

                    <p>Today, we stand as a fully operational clean energy platform, successfully developing, owning, and operating Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG) and organic fertilizer facilities. Our flagship plant demonstrates that sustainable energy can be both environmentally responsible and commercially viable.</p>

                    <h3>What Drives Us</h3>
                    <p>We operate at a critical intersection – where energy security meets climate action, where waste management meets value creation, and where rural economies meet modern infrastructure. Every ton of waste we process reduces emissions, creates clean energy, and generates economic opportunities for farming communities.</p>

                    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                    <p>To accelerate India's transition to renewable energy by converting agricultural and organic waste into high-quality bio-gas and organic fertilizers, creating sustainable value chains that empower rural communities while protecting our environment.</p>

                    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                    <p>To become India's most trusted bio-energy platform, recognized for operational excellence, innovation, and positive impact on communities and the climate. We envision a future where every agricultural region has access to waste-to-energy infrastructure that creates local jobs, reduces pollution, and generates clean fuel.</p>
